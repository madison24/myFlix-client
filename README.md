# myFlix app

## Objective
Using React, build the client-side for an app called myFlix based on its
existing server-side code movieApi(https://github.com/madison24/movieAPI)

## Features 
myFlix is a movie app that allows users to create a profile in order to:

- View movies from an api (created in movie_api)
- Search movies by title
- Add or remove movies to favorites
- Select a movie to view more info such as a brief description, the genre, the director, actors, and similar movies (movies in the same genre)
- Update or delete profile





Test myFlix-client using Parcel: parcel [Path to index.html]. Make sure to use the actual path to “index.html” instead of [Path to index.html] (relative to the current directory you’re inside).
For example: parcel src/index.html
